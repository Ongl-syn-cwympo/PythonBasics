# An example of a for loop 
# A for loop is used to display something a set amount of times.
# x is a variable that is used as a counter 

for x in range(10): # This repeats the message "Good morning" 10 times.
    print("Good morning") # This is the message
    
# An example of a while loop
# A while loop repeats until a condition is met

Num = 0 # Num is a variable

while(Num < 10): # This repeats the message "Good morning" until num is less than 10.
    print("Good morning") # Message
    Num = Num + 1 # Increase the value of the variable Num
