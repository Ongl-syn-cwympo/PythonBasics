# Asks the user to input their name & age and the program will save it and output it.

# Program asks for user name 
# Program prints the message "Good morning" + the entered name
# This printed message will show up on screen

# This asks for the user to enter their name (string)
Name = input("What's your name?") # The inputed message is saved in the variable "Name"
print("Good morning", Name) # The saved variable can be outputed, as shown here.

# We can make this a bit more complicated by adding age into the mix and outputing both of them.

# Program asks for user age 
# Program prints the entered age and "nice number!"
# This printed message will show up on screen

# This asks for the user to enter their age (integer)
Age = input("What's your age?") # The inputed message is saved in the variable "Age"
print(Age, "nice number!") # The saved variable can be outputed, as shown here.

# We can then output both of these variables together.

# Displayes both variables ~ The values assigned by the user
print(Name, Age) 

# What's a variable?
# A variable is a container for different types of data (like integer, float, String and etc...).
